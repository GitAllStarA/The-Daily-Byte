* Painting Houses
Dynamic Programming

This question is asked by Apple. You are tasked with painting a row of houses in your
* neighborhood such that each house is painted either red, blue, or green. The cost of
* painting the ith house red, blue or green, is given by costs[i][0], costs[i][1],
* and costs[i][2] respectively. Given that you are required to paint each house and no
* two adjacent houses may be the same color, return the minimum cost to paint all the houses.

Ex: Given the following costs arrayâ€¦

costs = [[1, 3, 5],[2, 4, 6],[5, 4, 3]], return 8.
Paint the first house red, paint the second house blue, and paint the third house green.
