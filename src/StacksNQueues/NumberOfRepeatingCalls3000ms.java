/*
*
* This question is asked by Google. Create a class CallCounter that tracks the number of calls a client has made within the last 3 seconds.
*  Your class should contain one method, ping(int t) that receives the current timestamp (in milliseconds) of a new call being made and returns the number
* of calls made within the last 3 seconds.
Note: you may assume that the time associated with each subsequent call to ping is strictly increasing.

Ex: Given the following calls to pingâ€¦

ping(1), return 1 (1 call within the last 3 seconds)
ping(300), return 2 (2 calls within the last 3 seconds)
ping(3000), return 3 (3 calls within the last 3 seconds)
ping(3002), return 3 (3 calls within the last 3 seconds)
ping(7000), return 1 (1 call within the last 3 seconds)
